This project is an interactive pathfinding game where the user can set the start and end points and build obstacles to make the algorithm to find the shortest path. 

The shortest path algorthim used is A* (star) which searches its neighbours while taking into account the estimated distance to the final destination. Find out more here: https://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/AStarComparison.html
